## Thoughts on a Flutter App
I would like to develop a Flutter app that:
- Has realtime updates and charts
- Can edit the name and location of a sensor
- Is not data specific, meaning that the user could have a barometer, themometer, ...
- Does not require rebuilding the app in order to connect to another database
- Is not platform specific, meaning that it works on mobile and web.
